    This is a procedurally generated world created with a mix of noises. The height maps are generated and the block types are choosen based on it's neighbors or its position. It's highly inspirated by the game Minecraft, that uses a similar way of building it's terrains.
    Another feature that I added was a lighting system. Each block has a different light pass and lights its neightbor blocks recursively.

Notes:
    The world generation is based on a single seed, a value that defines wich pseudo random numbers will be generated. Every world has a seed, and one seed can not generate two different worlds.

(If you spawn in the sea, you can refresh the page to ganerate a new seed)
